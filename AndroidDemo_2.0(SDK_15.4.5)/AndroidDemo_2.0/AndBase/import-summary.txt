ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* Doxyfile
* LICENSE-2.0.txt
* autolayout.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => app/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar => app/libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* proguard-project.txt => app/proguard-project.txt
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/com/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/.DS_Store
* src/com/ab/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/.DS_Store
* src/com/ab/util/image/arrow.png => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/util/image/arrow.png
* src/com/ab/util/image/crop_big.png => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/util/image/crop_big.png
* src/com/ab/util/image/crop_small.png => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/util/image/crop_small.png
* src/com/ab/view/chart/package.html => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/view/chart/package.html
* src/com/ab/view/slidingmenu/package.html => app/src/main/resources/com/ab/view/slidingmenu/package.html

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
